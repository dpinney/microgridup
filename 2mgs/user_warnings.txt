Supporting critical loads across microgrids assumes an AMI metering system. If not currently installed, add budget for the creation of an AMI system.
More than one existing battery storage asset is specified on microgrid mg1. Configuration of microgrid controller is not assumed to control multiple existing batteries, and thus all existing batteries will be removed from analysis of mg1.
Pre-existing battery battery_675_existing will not be utilized to support loads in microgrid mg1.
Pre-existing battery battery_675_2_existing will not be utilized to support loads in microgrid mg1.
